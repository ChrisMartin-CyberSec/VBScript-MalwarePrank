# VBScript-MalwarePrank
A Simple but Funny VBScript Malware Prank

UTILIZE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
For EDUCATIONAL and TESTING purposes only!

This is a VERY crude and short malware simulation that I utilized to prank my friends and relatives.

This script creates various message boxes (MsgBox) to simulate the old-school malware attacks seen in movies and TV.

For best results DO NOT close out the CMD prompt while running as the SendKeys function in VBScript send output to whichever window is in the foreground.

The script ends with a funny surprise.

Enjoy and feel free to add or modify to your liking!

Just remember, utilization of this script is AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

(I Always Recommend Using a Virtual Machine) :)
